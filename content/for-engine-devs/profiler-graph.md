# Profiler graph

The profiler graphs show the performance of Luanti in a more detailed fashion. This information is useful for engine developers. The profiler graphs are shown when you hit the debug key (F5 by default) twice.

The following graphs are available:

- **rudp_rtt**: ???
- **rudp_jitter**: ???
- **packets_lost**: ???
- **num_processed_meshes**: The engine generates geometric meshes from MapBlock data for drawing. This is the number of those meshes that finished generating in each frame.
- **mainloop_sleep**: If the game runs at a faster rate than `wanted_fps`, a sleep is inserted into each frame after drawing in order to not consume excess resources; this is that sleep time in seconds.
- **mainloop_other**: Time (in seconds) spent in each frame for everything else than drawing.
- **mainloop_dtime**: Total time (in seconds) spent per frame (`mainloop_other + mainloop_draw + mainloop_sleep`); FPS = 1 divided by this, averaged.
- **mainloop_draw**: Time (in seconds) spent in each frame for drawing (rendering).
- **client_received_packets**: Number of received high-level protocol packets in each frame.
