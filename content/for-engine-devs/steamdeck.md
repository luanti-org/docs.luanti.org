# Steam Deck

This page contains information useful for developing Luanti for the Steam Deck. Contact rubenwardy with any questions.

## Usage as an end user

See [rubenwardy's blog post](https://blog.rubenwardy.com/2022/12/02/minetest-steam-deck/)

## Installing a dev version

Uploading an AppImage using Deck DevKit
Source: https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/loadgames

- Name: MinetestAppImage
- Local folder: `/home/user/dev/tmp/minetestdeck/`
- Upload filtering [Include only] `Minetest-dev.AppImage`
- Start command: `Minetest-dev.AppImage`
- Save config
- Click Upload
- On deck: `cp /usr/lib/libcrypto.so ~/devkit-game/MinetestAppImage/libcrypto.so.1`
- Luanti should now be in Non-steam games as "Devkit games: MinetestAppImage"

Note, I had issues reusing the layout from the stable version of the game. Pressing "apply layout" did nothing. I needed to follow this bizarre workaround https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/10tsp1a/i_cant_change_the_default_controller_layout/
